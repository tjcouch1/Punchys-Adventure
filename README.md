# Punchys-Adventure
Action side-scrolling platformer game about saving the princess

Created in Construct 2 for Intro to Multimedia and Gaming class.

After presenting this game, a classmate approached me and told me to apply for my Hexagon intership in 2017! He worked there and was tasked with finding programming interns. How cool!
